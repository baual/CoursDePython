One of the few library requirements that we will need for this project is the request module that is available in Python. If you donâ€™t have it already, feel free to install the following module with a simple pip install command and import the library as shown below. This tool will allow us to directly access HTTP links for the required weather API applications.\n"

To generate your own API key, simply log in to the following website and create an account for totally free. You can either use one of their suggested API keys or generate one of your own. Paste this generated API key in a variable of your choice, as shown below."
